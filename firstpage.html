        From the filmmaker behind <span class="highlight">'The Dark Knight'</span> and <span
        class="highlight">'Memento'</span>, comes this gripping, wildly original
        thriller starring Leonardo DiCaprio as Cobb, the head of a criminal ring
        that specializes in a very unique type of corporate espionage: they invade
        the dreams of their victims to steal ideas. When he is asked to do something

      <p> <span class="title-paragraph">Reviews:</span>
        A selection of reviews from the Top Critics.
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-primary">
        <span class="style-text">"A spectacular fantasy thriller based on Nolan's
        own original screenplay, Inception is the smartest CGI head-trip since
        The Matrix."</span> - <strong>Tom Charity</strong>
        (<a href="http://edition.cnn.com/2010/SHOWBIZ/Movies/07/15/inception.review/"
        target="_blank">CNN.com</a>)
      </p>

      <p class="paragraph-secondary">
        <span class="style-text">"As engrossing and logic-resistant as the state
        of dreaming it seeks to replicate, Christopher Nolan's audacious new creation
        demands further study to fully absorb the multiple, simultaneous stories Nolan
        finagles into one narrative experience."</span> - <strong>Lisa Schwarzbaum</strong>
        (<a href="http://ew.com/article/2010/07/20/inception-3/"
        target="_blank">Entertainment Weekly</a>)
      </p>


      <p class="paragraph-primary">
        <span class="style-text">"Nolan blurs the distinction between dreams and
        reality so artfully that Inception may well be a masterpiece masquerading
        as a summer blockbuster."</span> - <strong>Lou Lumenick</strong>
        (<a href="http://nypost.com/2010/07/14/dream-team-2/"
        target="_blank">New York Post</a>)
      </p>


      <p class="paragraph-secondary">
        <span class="style-text">"Even as you tick off the film's overload of
        references, though -- a Matrix here, a James Bond there -- the amazing
        effects and Cobb's quest carry you along."</span> - <strong>Cary James</strong>
        (<a href="http://europe.newsweek.com/inception-christopher-nolans-dreamy-new-movie-74219?rm=eu"
        target="_blank">Newsweek</a>)
      </p>


      <p class="paragraph-primary">
        <span class="style-text">"In this wildly ingenÂ­ious chess game, grandmaster
        Nolan plants ideas in our heads that disturb and dazzle. The result is a
        knockout. But be warned: Inception dreams big. How cool is that?."</span>
        - <strong>Peter Travers</strong>
        (<a href="http://www.rollingstone.com/movies/reviews/inception-20100712"
        target="_blank">Rolling Stone</a>)
      </p>


      <p class="paragraph-secondary">
        <span class="style-text">"The film is easier to admire than to fully grasp
        or be moved by it. Still, it's worth surrendering to the dream."
        </span> - <strong>Claudia Puig</strong>
